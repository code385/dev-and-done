    detailedContent: `Hey there! 👋 So you're looking to build a web application? That's fantastic! Whether you're launching a SaaS product, an e-commerce platform, or a custom business application, we've got you covered.

Let me tell you what makes our web development approach special. We don't just write code - we build solutions that grow with your business. Every project starts with understanding your goals, your users, and your unique challenges.

We specialize in modern frameworks like Next.js because they give us the best of both worlds: the flexibility of React with production-ready features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and built-in API routes. This means your app will be fast, SEO-friendly, and scalable from day one.

But here's what really sets us apart: we think about the long term. We write clean, maintainable code that your team (or future developers) can actually understand and extend. We set up proper testing, documentation, and deployment pipelines so you can iterate quickly and confidently.

Whether you're a startup with a big idea or an established business looking to modernize, we'll work with you to build something you're proud of.`,

Let me tell you what makes our WordPress development approach special. We don't just install themes and plugins - we build custom solutions that are tailored to your business needs. Whether you need a simple blog, a complex e-commerce site, or a custom web application, we've got you covered.

We specialize in custom theme development because we believe your website should be unique to your brand. We build themes from scratch using modern best practices - clean, semantic code, responsive design, SEO optimization, and fast performance. We don't rely on bloated page builders that slow down your site.

For e-commerce, we use WooCommerce - the most powerful WordPress e-commerce solution. We create custom WooCommerce stores that are optimized for conversions, with custom checkout flows, payment integrations, and shipping solutions. Your customers will love the shopping experience.

We also develop custom plugins when off-the-shelf solutions don't fit. Need a custom booking system? A member portal? An integration with your existing tools? We'll build it for you.

Here's what sets us apart: we think about the long term. We build sites that are fast, secure, and easy to maintain. We use clean code that follows WordPress coding standards. We optimize for performance so your site loads quickly and ranks well in search engines.

Here's the thing - building a great mobile app isn't just about writing code. It's about understanding how people actually use their phones. We design and build apps that feel natural, perform smoothly, and solve real problems.

We primarily use React Native because it lets us build for both iOS and Android with a single codebase. This means faster development, easier maintenance, and consistent experiences across platforms. But we're not dogmatic - if your project needs native code for specific features, we'll write it in Swift or Kotlin.

What makes our mobile development special? We think about the entire user journey - from first download to daily usage. We optimize for performance, battery life, and data usage. We handle all the App Store complexities so you don't have to. And we build apps that scale from your first 100 users to millions.

Whether you're building a consumer app, a B2B tool, or something entirely new, we'll help you create an app that users love and that drives your business forward.`,

    detailedContent: `Hey! 🤖 Interested in adding AI to your application? You're in the right place! AI isn't just a buzzword anymore - it's becoming essential for creating exceptional user experiences and automating repetitive tasks.

Let me be honest with you - not every project needs AI, but when it's the right fit, it can be transformative. We help you figure out where AI makes sense and where it doesn't. We're not here to add AI just because it's cool - we add it because it solves real problems.

We work with various AI technologies depending on your needs. For most applications, we use OpenAI's API for chatbots and content generation. For specialized use cases, we build custom ML models. For automation, we use tools like LangChain to create intelligent workflows.

Here's what we've learned: the best AI integrations feel natural and helpful, not gimmicky. A chatbot that actually answers questions correctly. Automation that saves hours of manual work. Recommendations that users actually find useful.

We'll help you identify the right AI use cases, choose the best tools, implement them properly (with proper error handling and fallbacks), and monitor their performance. We'll also help you manage costs - AI APIs can get expensive, so we implement caching, rate limiting, and optimization strategies.

Here's our philosophy: design and development shouldn't be separate. We're designers who code and developers who design. This means we understand both the creative and technical sides, so we can create interfaces that are beautiful AND actually work well.

We start by understanding your users. Who are they? What are they trying to accomplish? What problems are they facing? Then we design solutions that make their lives easier, not harder.

We use modern tools like Figma for design and Framer Motion for animations, but the tools are less important than the process. We create wireframes first to get the structure right, then we design the visuals, and finally we implement with clean, maintainable code.

Accessibility isn't optional for us - it's fundamental. We design and build interfaces that work for everyone, following WCAG guidelines. This isn't just the right thing to do; it also makes your product better for all users.

We also think about the long term. We create design systems and component libraries so your interface stays consistent as it grows. We document everything so future developers (or you!) can maintain and extend the design.

We help you avoid that. We provide ongoing maintenance to keep your app healthy, optimize performance so it stays fast, and scale infrastructure so it can handle growth. We're like the mechanics for your application - we keep everything running smoothly so you can focus on your business.

Our maintenance includes regular updates, security patches, bug fixes, and performance monitoring. We set up proper CI/CD pipelines so deployments are smooth and safe. We implement monitoring and alerting so you know about issues before users do.

When it comes to scaling, we don't just throw more servers at the problem. We optimize code, implement caching strategies, optimize databases, and architect for scale. We help you scale efficiently so costs don't spiral out of control.
